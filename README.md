# deno_changesets

ðŸ¦• Deno native way to manage versioning and changelogs.

```bash
deno run --unstable --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/deno_changesets/main.ts --help
```

## Getting started

There are a few constraints to consider when using deno_changesets:

- Versioning follows [semver](https://semver.org)
- Changelogs follow [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- Versions are stored as git tags
- Repositories should expose a single module (subdirectory support coming soon)
- There are no configuration options

See: [Adding a module](https://deno.land/add_module) on the Deno docs.

## Creating a changeset

Creates a new changeset inside the `.changeset` folder.

```bash
deno run --unstable --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/deno_changesets/main.ts create
```

## Releasing

Releasing collects all previously created changsets, translates them to a
version bump (patch, minor, major) with the highest taking precedence, updates
changelogs, and then pushes to remote.

```bash
deno run --unstable --allow-read --allow-write https://deno.land/x/deno_changesets/main.ts release
```
